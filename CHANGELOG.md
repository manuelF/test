# Changelog - unittest

##0.10.0-dev

* Each test is run in a seperate `Zone`. This ensures that any exceptions that
occur is async operations are reported back to the source test case.
* **DEPRECATED** `guardAsync`, `protectAsync0`, `protectAsync1`,
and `protectAsync2`
    * Running each test in a `Zone` addresses the need for these methods.
* `TestCase`:
    * Removed properties: `setUp`, `tearDown`, `testFunction`
    * `enabled` is now get-only
    * Removed methods: `pass`, `fail`, `error`
* `interactive_html_config.dart` has been removed.
* `runTests`, `tearDown`, `setUp`, `test`, `group`, `solo_test`, and
  `solo_group` now throw a `StateError` if called while tests are running.
* `rerunTests` has been removed.
